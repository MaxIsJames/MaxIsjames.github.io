**Monument Valley 2** is the award winning second installment in the Monument Valley series. A followup that builds on the incredibly
strong foundation of its predecessor and uses it to tell an honest and emotional story family and motherhood. <br>

I worked on the **Monument Valley 2** team as the sole technical artist, and animator. Over the development of this title, I provided tooling, pipelines,
animation, and artist support, as well as 'art-ing' a handful of levels within the game.
